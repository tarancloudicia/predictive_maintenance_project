# Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Machinery

## Overview

This project demonstrates a machine learning application for predictive maintenance in industrial machinery. The system uses historical data to train a model that can predict when maintenance is needed, helping to reduce downtime and optimize maintenance schedules.

## Features

- **Data Upload**: Upload CSV files containing machinery data.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize the data to identify patterns and trends.
- **Model Training**: Train a machine learning model to predict maintenance needs.
- **Prediction**: Predict maintenance requirements for new data.
- **Download Predictions**: Export the predictions as a CSV file.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/tarancloudicia/predictive_maintenance.git
   ```
2. Change into the project directory:
   ```
   cd predictive_maintenance
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
2. Upload your machinery data CSV file.
3. Visualize the data and train the model.
4. Upload new data to make predictions.
5. Download the prediction results.

## Sample Data

A sample CSV file (`machine_data.csv`) is provided in the `data` directory to get you started.
This Sample can also be downloaded via the UI.
